# kickstarter_Analysis
## Overview of project
### This report dives deep into the outcomes of various campaigns based on their launch date and funding goals. Using Microsoft Excel, data has been sorted and visualized to understand it better.
## Analysis and Challenge
### After reviewing data from the datasheet, theatre outcomes based on launch date are visualized using line chart [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10XzUahs5EHGz_5rcE4T4dt1pGUVmD0J-/view?usp=sharing). It is found that the success rate is higher as compared to the failure and cancellation rate. The success rate is higher in the month of May along with the highest failure rate.
### The challenging part was to visualize the relationship between the goal-amount ranges and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W-i9p1Zuo1bRN94YWLszGapPaB40olRL/view?usp=sharing). Hints in the help section came in handy while analyzing data using COUNTIFS() function.
## Results
### Deliverable 1: The success rate remained higher than the failure and cancellation rate throughout the campaign. The success rate had high fluctuations with it being highest in May and low in December. Failure and cancellation rates remained steady.
### Deliverable 2: The failure rate was high for higher goals while the success rate was high for smaller goals, especially under $30,000.
## Limitations
### Data was huge to examine different categories for different datasets. Pivot tables and line charts helped in analyzing and understanding data to a greater extent. There were outliers in the data which made conclusions a bit challenging as they were hard to be identified.
